# degreeConverter

This project was for me to play around and create an web app that can convert degrees between Cel and Fah. This started as a group project and then I expanded and added more to it.

#How It Was Made

HTML,CSS,and Javascript

As a group we discussed and broke down this app into steps. We whiteboard the steps for everyone to work together to get the first convertor working. We did the HTML and the Javascript for the first degree measurement.

#Optimizations

I personalized this myself and added did the CSS myself, and added the second degree measurement and buttons and settings to show or hide what is need and not necessary at the moment.

#Lessons Learned

I learned syntax for the event listener
I learned how to use methods in certain places
I learned how to keep break up the problem into tiny steps
